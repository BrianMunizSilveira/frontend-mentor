## Overview

### Screenshot

![Screenshot](https://imgur.com/sKiodHi.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this challenge I was able to better consolidate the concepts of Flexbox and use variables with CSS in a real project, which is very useful but I don't see many people using it (or I didn't look hard enoughðŸ˜…).  Another highlight was the expansive use of classes for styling, something I'm getting used to as I'm used to only using tags for direct styling.

```css
:root {
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    --dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);

    --font: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

Although I managed to complete the QR Code challenge, I'm not entirely comfortable using flexbox concepts, as it's still new to me, but with practice it will become easier.
